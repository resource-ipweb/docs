# Dolphin Anty + IPWeb Static Native Proxy Setup Guide

*Before using IPWeb proxy services, make sure your local network can reliably access international websites and services. If you encounter connection issues, check your local network connection or contact customer support for assistance.*

IPWeb provides **70M+ clean residential IPs** across **220+ countries and regions**, with support for HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols. It can support a wide range of use cases, including data collection, account management, and ad verification.

Among them, **Static Native Proxies** provide stable, fixed outbound IP addresses, making them better suited for use cases that require consistent network environments and reliable connections. This guide covers the complete process, from registration, free trial, and purchasing a Static Native Proxy to configuring and verifying an IPWeb proxy in the **Dolphin Anty fingerprint browser**.

## Basic Setup

### 1. Create an Account

Open the IPWeb website at `https://ipweb.cc`, then click [**sign up**](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-up) in the top navigation bar. If you already have an account, click [**sign in**](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-in) instead.

On the registration page, **Email Register** is available by default. Enter your account name/email address, email verification code, password, and password confirmation. Click **Send Code**, then check your email for the verification code. After completing the required fields, agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then click **Sign Up** to complete registration. You can also switch to **Mobile Register** and follow the on-screen instructions to register with your mobile number.

If you already have an account, go directly to the sign-in page and log in with your account name/email address and password. You can also switch to phone number login.

The sign-in page also provides a **Sign in with Google** option, allowing you to quickly register or log in with your Google account without entering separate email registration details.

### 2. Claim Free Trial Traffic

After registration, log in to the [IPWeb User Dashboard](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-in) for the first time and contact customer support to receive **free trial traffic** for testing all proxy types.

> New users can use the trial traffic to test proxy performance first, then choose a paid plan after confirming that it meets their needs.

### 3. Purchase a Static Native Proxy

After logging in to the IPWeb User Dashboard, go to **Proxy Products** → **Static Native Proxy** → **Buy Proxy** from the left-hand navigation menu.

On the purchase page, choose **Dedicated** or **Shared** based on your requirements, and decide whether to enable **Custom purchase**.

![IPWeb Static Native Proxy purchase page](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/static-native-buy-proxy-custom-dedicated-steps-en.png)

When purchasing, make sure to review the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dedicated / Shared | Dedicated proxies are used exclusively by the current account, while shared proxies use a shared resource pool |
| Country / Region | Select the desired proxy exit location. Available locations depend on the resources currently shown in the dashboard |
| Use Case | Select a use case if you have a specific business scenario; otherwise, you can leave it unselected |
| UDP | Enable or disable UDP based on the software, protocol, and business requirements you use |
| Bandwidth | Select the bandwidth specification required for the current proxy instance |
| Connections (QPS) | Select the appropriate specification based on your actual concurrent request requirements |
| IP Subscription Period | Select the service period for the proxy IP |
| Number of IPs | Enter the number of IPs you want to purchase |

If **Custom purchase** is disabled, the page switches to preset package mode, where bandwidth, QPS, UDP, and other parameters are determined by the selected package.

After confirming that the country/region, specifications, subscription period, number of IPs, and total amount are correct, click **Place Order**. Once the order is generated, select one of the supported payment methods and complete the payment. After the order is confirmed, line provisioning usually takes about **3–5 minutes**. Please wait for the system to complete resource provisioning.

For detailed information about Dedicated/Shared proxies, Custom Purchase, specification options, and the payment process, see the [IPWeb Static Native Proxy User Guide](https://docs.ipweb.cc/static-native-user-guide/).

### 4. View Proxy Connection Details

After your Static Native Proxy has been purchased and activated, go to **Proxy Products** → **Static Native Proxy** → **My IPs** from the left-hand navigation menu to view the proxy resources purchased under the current account.

![IPWeb purchased Static Native Proxy IPs page](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/static-native-my-ips-en.png)

In the proxy list, pay particular attention to the following details, which will be used later when configuring Dolphin Anty:

- **IP**: The purchased Static Native Proxy address;
- **Port**: The port used to connect to the proxy;
- **Username / Password**: The authentication credentials used to connect to the proxy;
- **Status**: Make sure the current proxy resource is available.

The page also displays information such as country/region, bandwidth, Shared/Dedicated status, connections (QPS), expiration/renewal, and UDP. These details can be used to verify the current proxy resource. When configuring Dolphin Anty later, you will mainly use the **proxy IP, port, username, and password** shown here.

For information about proxy filtering, account export, renewals, and other management operations, see the [IPWeb Static Native Proxy User Guide](https://docs.ipweb.cc/static-native-user-guide/).

## Configure IPWeb Proxy in Dolphin Anty

After completing the steps above and obtaining the IPWeb **proxy host, proxy port, proxy username, and proxy password**, you can configure the proxy in **Dolphin Anty**.

### 1. Create a New Browser Profile

Open the Dolphin Anty client. On the **All profiles** page, click the **+** button at the top to create a new browser profile.

![Create a new browser profile in Dolphin Anty](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/dolphinanty-1.png)

### 2. Enter the IPWeb Proxy Details

On the **New profile** page, go to the **General** section, find the **Proxy** settings, and select **New proxy**.

In the proxy settings area, enter the proxy information provided by IPWeb:

- **Proxy protocol**: Select the protocol that matches the proxy provided by IPWeb, such as `HTTP`, `SOCKS4`, or `SOCKS5`.

- **Proxy**: Enter the proxy server information provided by IPWeb, including the proxy host, port, username, and password.

- **Change IP URL**: If the current IPWeb proxy provides an IP rotation or refresh URL, enter it here. Otherwise, leave this field blank.

- **Proxy name**: Enter a proxy name if needed for easier identification and management, or leave it blank.

The proxy protocol selected in Dolphin Anty must match the protocol actually provided by IPWeb. If the wrong protocol is selected, the connection may fail even when the proxy host, port, username, and password are correct.

![Enter IPWeb proxy details in Dolphin Anty](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/dolphinanty-2.png)

After the proxy information is entered, Dolphin Anty will check the proxy connection.

If the proxy is available, a connection status will appear below the proxy field together with IP geolocation details such as country/region, state/province, city, and time zone. This indicates that the IPWeb proxy can be connected successfully.

If the proxy check fails, check the following:

- Make sure the proxy host and port are entered correctly;

- Make sure the proxy username and password are correct;

- Make sure the proxy protocol selected in Dolphin Anty matches the protocol provided by IPWeb;

- Make sure the current proxy is still active;

- Check whether your local network can connect to the proxy server normally.

### 3. Create and Launch the Browser Profile

After confirming that the proxy is working, continue configuring other settings such as the browser fingerprint, platform, and User-Agent as needed.

After confirming the settings, click **CREATE PROFILE** in the lower-right corner to create the browser profile.

![Create and launch the browser profile in Dolphin Anty](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/dolphinanty-3.png)

Return to the **All profiles** page, find the profile you just created, and click **START**. Once launched, network requests from that browser profile will access target websites through the configured IPWeb proxy.
