# VMLogin + IPWeb Static Native Proxy Setup Guide

*Before using IPWeb proxy services, make sure your local network can reliably access international websites and services. If you encounter connection issues, check your local network connection or contact customer support for assistance.*

IPWeb provides **70M+ clean residential IPs** across **220+ countries and regions**, with support for HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols. It can support a wide range of use cases, including data collection, account management, and ad verification.

Among them, **Static Native Proxies** provide stable, fixed outbound IP addresses, making them better suited for use cases that require consistent network environments and reliable connections. This guide covers the complete process, from registration, free trial, and purchasing a Static Native Proxy to configuring and verifying an IPWeb proxy in the **VMLogin fingerprint browser**.

## Basic Setup

### 1. Create an Account

Open the IPWeb website at `https://ipweb.cc`, then click [**sign up**](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-up) in the top navigation bar. If you already have an account, click [**sign in**](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-in) instead.

On the registration page, **Email Register** is available by default. Enter your account name/email address, email verification code, password, and password confirmation. Click **Send Code**, then check your email for the verification code. After completing the required fields, agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then click **Sign Up** to complete registration. You can also switch to **Mobile Register** and follow the on-screen instructions to register with your mobile number.

If you already have an account, go directly to the sign-in page and log in with your account name/email address and password. You can also switch to phone number login.

The sign-in page also provides a **Sign in with Google** option, allowing you to quickly register or log in with your Google account without entering separate email registration details.

### 2. Claim Free Trial Traffic

After registration, log in to the [IPWeb User Dashboard](https://user.ipweb.cc/console/sign-in) for the first time and contact customer support to receive **free trial traffic** for testing all proxy types.

> New users can use the trial traffic to test proxy performance first, then choose a paid plan after confirming that it meets their needs.

### 3. Purchase a Static Native Proxy

After logging in to the IPWeb User Dashboard, go to **Proxy Products** → **Static Native Proxy** → **Buy Proxy** from the left-hand navigation menu.

On the purchase page, choose **Dedicated** or **Shared** based on your requirements, and decide whether to enable **Custom purchase**.

![IPWeb Static Native Proxy purchase page](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/static-native-buy-proxy-custom-dedicated-steps-en.png)

When purchasing, make sure to review the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dedicated / Shared | Dedicated proxies are used exclusively by the current account, while shared proxies use a shared resource pool |
| Country / Region | Select the desired proxy exit location. Available locations depend on the resources currently shown in the dashboard |
| Use Case | Select a use case if you have a specific business scenario; otherwise, you can leave it unselected |
| UDP | Enable or disable UDP based on the software, protocol, and business requirements you use |
| Bandwidth | Select the bandwidth specification required for the current proxy instance |
| Connections (QPS) | Select the appropriate specification based on your actual concurrent request requirements |
| IP Subscription Period | Select the service period for the proxy IP |
| Number of IPs | Enter the number of IPs you want to purchase |

If **Custom purchase** is disabled, the page switches to preset package mode, where bandwidth, QPS, UDP, and other parameters are determined by the selected package.

After confirming that the country/region, specifications, subscription period, number of IPs, and total amount are correct, click **Place Order**. Once the order is generated, select one of the supported payment methods and complete the payment. After the order is confirmed, line provisioning usually takes about **3–5 minutes**. Please wait for the system to complete resource provisioning.

For detailed information about Dedicated/Shared proxies, Custom Purchase, specification options, and the payment process, see the [IPWeb Static Native Proxy User Guide](https://docs.ipweb.cc/static-native-user-guide/).

### 4. View Proxy Connection Details

After your Static Native Proxy has been purchased and activated, go to **Proxy Products** → **Static Native Proxy** → **My IPs** from the left-hand navigation menu to view the proxy resources purchased under the current account.

![IPWeb purchased Static Native Proxy IPs page](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/static-native-my-ips-en.png)

In the proxy list, pay particular attention to the following details, which will be used later when configuring VMLogin:

- **IP**: The purchased Static Native Proxy address;
- **Port**: The port used to connect to the proxy;
- **Username / Password**: The authentication credentials used to connect to the proxy;
- **Status**: Make sure the current proxy resource is available.

The page also displays information such as country/region, bandwidth, Shared/Dedicated status, connections (QPS), expiration/renewal, and UDP. These details can be used to verify the current proxy resource. When configuring VMLogin later, you will mainly use the **proxy IP, port, username, and password** shown here.

For information about proxy filtering, account export, renewals, and other management operations, see the [IPWeb Static Native Proxy User Guide](https://docs.ipweb.cc/static-native-user-guide/).

## Configure IPWeb Proxy in VMLogin

After completing the steps above and obtaining the IPWeb **proxy IP address, port, username, and password**, you can configure the proxy in **VMLogin**.

### 1. Create a New Browser Profile

Open VMLogin and click **New browser profile** on the left.

![Create a new browser profile in VMLogin](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/vmlogin-1-en.png)

On the profile configuration page, under **Basic configuration**, click **Setting proxy server** to open the proxy settings window.

![Open proxy settings in VMLogin](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/vmlogin-2-en.png)

### 2. Configure the IPWeb Proxy

First, enable **Enable proxy server**, then enter the proxy information provided by IPWeb:

- **Proxy type**: Select the protocol that matches the IPWeb proxy, such as `HTTP Proxy` or `SOCKS5 Proxy`.

- **IP address**: Enter the IPWeb proxy host.

- **Port**: Enter the corresponding proxy port.

- **Username**: Enter the proxy username.

- **Password**: Enter the proxy password.

![Enter IPWeb proxy details in VMLogin](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/vmlogin-3-en.png)

If you have already copied the complete proxy information, you can also click **Paste proxy info**, then verify that each field has been parsed correctly.

The proxy protocol selected in VMLogin must match the protocol used when obtaining the proxy from IPWeb.

### 3. Test the Proxy Connection

After entering the proxy information, select a test site under **Test IP URL**, then click **Test Proxy**.

If the test succeeds, VMLogin will display the current proxy exit IP together with details such as country, city, region, time zone, and other location information.

![Test the IPWeb proxy in VMLogin](https://oss.ipweb.cc/docs/imgs/2026/09/vmlogin-4-en.png)

After confirming that the proxy can connect successfully, click **Confirm** to close the test result, then click **Save** in the proxy settings window.

Return to the browser profile configuration page, complete any other settings as needed, then click **Save profile**.

After saving, locate the corresponding profile under **Browser profile** and launch it to use the configured IPWeb proxy.
